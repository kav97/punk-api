## About the project ðŸ’­

- I was tasked with creating website based on the Brewdog Catalogue using the Punk API.
- Initially I used [beers.js](https://gist.github.com/DanForder/63698b304305a96595dfb1b45f81e486) as a sample file to start project.
- Once I got the information I needed from beers.js and the overall design set out. I called down the beers from the API using the GET endpoint and its relevant URL parameters (later for filtering).

## Future improvements ðŸŒŸ
- I would like to include pagination to my app. This would allow for smaller and elegant design. Also, increase the speed of rendering all the beer cards.
- Routing each card to a new page using its unique ID; to display more information about a selected beer.
